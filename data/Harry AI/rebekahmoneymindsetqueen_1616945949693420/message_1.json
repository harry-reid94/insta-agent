If money is attached to self worth it's going to impact every decision, exemplified in crypto etc\n\nTimezones are no problem generally, but if you're in Dubai they certainly wont be haha. I've just met up with a couple clients who have passed by Dubai and that's always a pleasure as well",

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a game and now a fun one to play! \n\nI think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what gets most people in trouble. The emotional attachment to what they think money means. About them, about the world and their worth. \n\nI had mastered this game now and why I love teaching it! Especially to women. \n\nYes booked in for Wednesday and was happy to find a time that worked! \n\nIf I go inner circle and have monthly calls with you I will be in Dubai by then anyway so should be fine for Timezones. \n\nSo cam is your business partner and he will just take me through the options?",

As long as you have the data, analysis and tools behind you otherwise the market can be unforgiving as you know.\n\nAfter that its really simple to implement, just need to remain emotionless and trust the strategy and data that is tried and proven.\n\nand to be honest I do the same, most of my time is taken up with research and analysis and serving my clients so i've invested in countless trading and business mentors.

Most people I serve have their businesses and cashflow which needs their attention and I oversea and give them the information they need two-fold - 1, for their actual positions (which generally replicate mine) and 2, to speed-track their knowledge so they are across where there money is and they're not just blindly following me.\n\nIll send you a message now!",

Data driven exits and entries are what saved my members from 10's millions in loss and the accumulating effect of that is substantial, especially over the next 12 months.\n\nI am in Dubai.
